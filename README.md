# QEC-with-spin-qubits

The python scripts used for our manuscript "Tailoring quantum error correction to spin qubits" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17786).

In order to calculate the threshold for a given set of error biases (e.g., readout errors are 10x more likely than gate errors), have a look at the Threshold_surfaces_demo.ipynb notebook.

Prerequisites:
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Reproducing results:
In order to reproduce the results of the paper use the included bash scripts, keeping in mind that it requires ~ 5 core years.
